This repository contains prototypes for the **Mermaid Runner** endless runner game.

- `mermaid_runner.py` – A Pygame prototype.
- `gamemaker/` – GML scripts for a GameMaker implementation.

Use the GameMaker scripts to create objects (`obj_player`, `obj_obstacle`, `obj_controller`, `obj_chaser`) and attach the code to their events as explained in `gamemaker/README.md`.
